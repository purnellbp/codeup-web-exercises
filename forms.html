    Create text fields for email and password with appropriate placeholder values.

    Create a textarea named "bio". This is for the user to fill out a short description of themselves.

    Create a "How did you hear about us" section that contains radio buttons. The values should be "billboard",
    "radio advertisement", "internet advertisement", and "other".
    Only one of the values should be allowed to be selected at a time.

    What happens if the inputs are given different name attributes?
    Change these inputs so that multiple answers are allowed to be selected.
    Create a dropdown that asks the user what web browser they are using.

    As you work through the steps above, you should:

    Make sure all of your form elements have labels.
    Ensure that all of your form values are being submitted to the Request Inspector.
    Experiment with different attribute values:
    What do you notice when changing the form's request method from GET to POST?
    What happens if you leave off the name attribute on an input?
    What happens if you leave off the id attribute on a form input?
